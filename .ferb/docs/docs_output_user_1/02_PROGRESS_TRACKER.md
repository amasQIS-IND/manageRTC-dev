## WEEK 1 REMAINING TASKS

### Day 6: Socket.IO Analysis ✅ COMPLETED

**Tasks:**
- [x] Analyze all Socket.IO controllers ✅ DONE
- [x] Document Socket.IO vs REST migration strategy ✅ DONE
- [x] Create brutal validation document ✅ DONE

**Files Created:**

**Key Findings:**
- **35 Socket.IO controllers** currently attached across roles
- Admin role has **27 controllers** attached via Socket.IO
- HR role has **24 controllers** attached via Socket.IO

**Migration Strategy Decided:**
- **80% REST** for CRUD operations (data retrieval, standard operations)
- **20% Socket.IO** for real-time features (chat, notifications, live updates)
- **Hybrid approach** for features needing both (kanban, dashboard, file management)

**Socket.IO Features to Keep:**
1. Chat messaging (core real-time feature)
2. Social feed (live posts/likes/comments)
3. Kanban drag-drop (multi-user sync)
4. Dashboard live updates (counter updates)
5. File upload progress (progress bars)
6. Online presence (typing indicators, status)
7. Notifications (instant alerts)

**REST Operations to Implement:**
- All CRUD for Employee ✅, Project ✅, Task ✅
- Lead, Client, Asset CRUD (next)
- Attendance, Leave CRUD (next phase)
- Training, Performance CRUD (later phases)

**Blockers:**
- None
